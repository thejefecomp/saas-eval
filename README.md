# saas-eval
Repository created to host a solution presented to an exam performed by a Job Interview, which is to fulfil a role to work on the development of the SAAS system.


IMPORTANT NOTE: The language utilised within the entire project is English. 


The implemented subsystem presents initial classes to fulfil what was requested in the assignment, which includes only the
requested features accessed through the BusinessLayer represented by the class org.thejefecomp.atm.business.ATMBusiness. No modules are included as their organisation 
depends on the entire architecture of the system as a whole, which is out of the scope of the assignment.

The project uses Apache Maven as a Build tool, providing Unit tests to cover common test cases.
